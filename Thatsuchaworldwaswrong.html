<body>That such a world was wrong
we knew, nothing living ever grew
to wit, a wasted life was lost
as by a tempest we were tossed 
our pale flesh pressed against the dust,
so iron creatures do succumb to rust
and flight a dream and we now wake
to falling long to feel bones break
beneath, on land so grey and desolate
long years given over to regret
this wan pair ruined by the hope 
that some strong hand held fast the end of rope 
to pull these poor souls free from the abyss
now all consolation laden in the kiss
I place upon your brow in anguished flinch
that I would wake you with a playful pinch
from years of misery, the toll you paid, 
though you did not beseech God to be made
and yet through all the darkness, there a glow
from which a flame I promise to see grow
</body>
