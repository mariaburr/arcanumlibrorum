<body>The merely odd does not last
as the gentle rain of heaven on those beneath
a great fear of mankind
one of your creatures, Lord,
he bears the mark of death
to remind him that you <i>thwart the pround</i>.
The world is a mere hotch-potch of random cohesions
and dispersions. Why wish to survive in such a purposeless confusion,
why care about anything, save the manner of the ultimate return to dust?

Why trouble my head at all? Do what I will, dispersion must overtake me.
