<body>The <a href="theremnant.html" class="hidden">remains</a> of the original
the early ancestors of all mankind
tents strung out over several nights
possibly because water was available there
prostitutes, gangsters, impoverished tradesmen

There is evidence they lived there ten centuries ago.
Stone-walled ruins of towns and villages scattered round those parts
destroyed and driven away during wars emanating from offshoot kingdoms

old warehouse industrial buildings once lay decaying
a place of inspiration, to do business, a safe residence, a beacon.
There is nothing left

but banded ironstones and marine lava deposits, interspersed with softer, easily eroded tillites, mudstones and conglomerates
the outcrop forms the ridge from which the basin and its rocks derive
gold was embedded in a conglomerate, 
assumed to be alluvial gold in an old riverbed
tilted by earth movements

not merely developed for the narrow width of a river, but continued in depth, 
there came the realisation that this conglomeratic zone was of sedimentary succession.

Gold occurs only along northern and western margins of this basin, but no continuous band.

Archean rivers 
from north and west 
formed fan deltas,                  (gold bearing fan deltas now below the surface)
many braided channels, before 
flowing south to Witwatersand Sea

associated with rapid and frequent variation
separated by small, often temporary, islands
once a given system crosses a threshold value it will convert from meandering to braided
a lagoon located on the river-coast interface
wide, shallow channels, preventing the helical flow
all contain young, rapidly eroding mountains
