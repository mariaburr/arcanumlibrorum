Certain fields 
involve travel to the past.   Positive attraction 
               accompanied by negative potential, 
      distance approaches  infinity, a kind of binding 
      energy.  Look here.  Is that the way of it?      I was talking about God 
                                                     and one thing and another, 
                                                     and suddenly I felt something inside me 
                                                                                   like a man 
                                                                            trying to get out. 
                                                       I arose        in my bed. 
                                                       I puked till I puked air. 
                                    A universe which dominates will 
                                                  inevitably collapse. 
                                    An open universe           will 
                                                    indefinitely 
                                                    disintegrate. 
It is unclear.

Principle allows the vacuum to be filled spontaneously and exist  a short time. 
Typically, before annihilating again. Behavior plays a role, placed very close, 
restrict that which can exist  between,  squeezed  light,  interposed  a laugh.
