<body>Eher the following winter, had overed the pages of <a href="Explainnature.html" class="hidden">nature's book</a>, the shadow of the huge outlander,
attention drawn to the error by four red obeli running between the lines, round the margins and about the corners,
will be <i>true</i> if nothing be taught but as is beneficial lest there be a cause of complaining afterwards. 
We know not necessary things, because we have not learned things necessary. I wish to speak, remember, by the first,

so fair, such splended purpose in his eyes,                                             
built fanes of fruitless prayer, 
trusted God was love,
though Nature red in tooth and claw
with ravine, shrieked against his creed.

A stone of various colours, shining gloriously, foot path sand and so gravel rubbish vandal
thin fire of the Carbuncle,
fulgent purple of Amethist,
the green sea of the Emerauld,
pale with a glittering verging to a golden colour,
Hyacinth, aer of wax, of oyle.
The rays reflected from Leafe Gold are yellow
but those trasmitted are blew.
Liquor looked on in a cleare violl 
reflects blew rays & transmits yellow.
And if the liquor being too much impregnated
appears of a darke red it may bee diluted
with faire water till it appeare of a Golden Colour. 

It is to be supposed that there is an æthereal medium 
much of the same constitution with air, but far rarer,
subtler, more elastic, compounded partly of the main plegmatic body,
partly other various spirits, as electric and magnetic effluvia
and gravitating principle argue. Perhaps the whole frame of nature 
may be naught but contextures of some certain spirits condensed
as it were by precipitation, as exhalations into grosser substances,
afterward wrought into various forms, first by the hand of the Creator,
ever since by nature, by virtue of the command: increase and multiply 
become a complete imitator of the copies set her by the protoplast.
Thus perhaps may all things be originated.

I suppose there is such a spirit, that animal spirits are neither
like liquor or vapour of wine, but æthereal, subtil enough 
to pervade the animal juices. The coats of the brain, nerves, and muscles
a convenient vessel to hold so subtil a spirit, as water and oil
pervade wood and stone, which quicksilver does not.
If the vital spirit of man be very sociable
to the marrow and juices, and unsociable
to the coats of the brain &c, or any thing 
lodged in the pores of those we suppose 
no great violence done to it to squeeze
it out, it may not be so subtil as
the main body of æther
between the earth and heaven,
and that, any spent is continually
supplied anew from the heart.

You must know that I was suffering
from some dreadful complaint, and he
generously intended to have me cured
at his own expense. He was deaf as a post,
which I did not know. He said I looked very ill.
I answered that, thanks to God, my greatest affliction
was poverty. Producing a case of surgical instruments,
he assured me he would perform an operation
which he trusted would very soon relieve me.

After making many profound observations upon nature,
having employed my senses, my spectacles, and a very large telescope,
I said one day that unless I am much deceieved,
I cannot discover any trace of what the world calls <i>nature</i>.
On the contrary, everything seems to me to be the work of art.
I am convinced some genius aranged things such that the square 
of the revolutions of the planets is always proportional
to the cubic root from their distance to the centre.
Only a magician could discover how this was done.
The tides of the sea, all animals, vegetables, and minerals,
are arranged with due regard to weight and measure, number and motion.
All is performed by springs, levers, pullies, hydraulic machines,
and chemical combinations, from the insignificant flea to man,
from a grain of sand to the firmament of heaven.
<i>Nature</i> is but a chimera.

I am always astonished 
that a grain of wheat
cast into the earth
will yield in short time
a handful of the same corn.
The wheat must die
before it can return,
a result first published
by an apostle called Paul.

The Book of Hell's Compulsion, secured by iron chain in the church at Zellerfeld,
written by Doctor Faust, only few can read it. It is extremely dangerous to read it.
To read it without losing one's life, one must read it forwards and backwards.
Forwards, the devil appears. Backwards, he will depart. If read forwards and not backwards,
the devil does the rest. But there is no longer any magic or witchcraft,
because the book can no longer be used. The sixth and seventh books of Moses,
in which all magic incantations were exactly recorded, can no longer be used.

Many years ago the wife of an old master tailor inherited a strange book from her mother.
Whenever she read from it, deer and wolves and hares and other animals
would come and lie down at her feet and play with her children,
and disappear the moment the book was closed.
One day while reading her husband
grabbed the book and threw it on the hearth.
The fire went out, the book undamaged.
Fearing to have the book in his house,
he had a boy born on a Sunday during the sermon
take the book and depart.
