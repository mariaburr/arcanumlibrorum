<body><a class="hidden" href="Theendoftheendoftheend.html">the</a> central parable
contrasts this with

creation of useful goods
concludes with a vision
of Hell
        populated by perverters
        of long age and oddoer

stone forest growing from water
grouping phrases, words, images

Ovid, Propertius, Catullus,
Roland, Daniel, exemplum

fragments constellate
to form a clear song 

inert indolent lotus eaters
a contrast to that activity

a nexus of survival

destruction of the Cathar stronghold to end the Albigensian Crusade
destruction of Troy, voyage to the Holy Land, closing lines return

echoes the ruin of eblis
on transatlantic flight
return to the world
of the clear song 

a glimpse of the printer

    tempus loquendi, tempus tacendi
    general indefinite wobble
    of decaying Mitteleuropa

Donna mi pregha, Eriugena condemned?
The man who made the tempest?

the problem of purchasing power
returns to the island of Circe 
events before the voyage under

taken a hymn to ritual sex
conspiracy against the public

a periplous, 
another lament 
on the waste of war
