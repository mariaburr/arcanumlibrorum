About a kilometre further east from the end, beyond the dunes, lies False Island, where a high promontory juts out towards the sea. On top of the headland that extends the furthest, a replica of the cross has been erected on the same bleak, exposed spot.)

                                                                             Mountains inverted. Sound dead. Bound time twisted and tough troubled wandering a wan way through. Climb within thy trembling breast.
                                                                     The trouble will split us a small flicker through I would be unchained
                                                                                       Clinging to the glimpse a battle when nobody will
                                                                                             How can I feel?
                                                                                       dependence upon inaccessible strangers
                                                                         dependence upon the last fail safe left
                                                                                        not allowed to sleep in day
                                                                              the act of living a fate worse than death
                                                                                  dependence upon what once was
                                                                                              it won't ever again
                                                                                          to sleep, to dream, would be enough
                                                                                                 After revived
                                                              Distant, dead. Why you, here? I thought. Buried in a sludge, in the damp distant.                                
                                                                                    I burnt. Wet, dank burning. Looked like a bird stomach.                                                                                      
                                                                                                    So small now no one sees.
                                                                                                     A warning came
                                          I have traveled in every world. Most today are desolate. The remains overwhelm what once was becoming. I have seen and not seen. The grey wastes surround indistinct suffering of non-entities writhing around in accumulating filth and misery. I tried, I swear it. I listened, I heard him listening. He, thin and towering, watched and waited. And I waited. And did never find him. He found me exhausted and dead but I'm alive again, to warn you I was spared my fate.
                                                                                       There is simply naught
                                          It was the desolation. A blunt impact. I could not see it. I could not see it I continued. He was the listening sound. Nothing clean only the waste. The shrine gold and bloodied.
                                                                                                     I have seen
       I have seen the void I woke up in the trench along the endless road eyes and limbs dislocated I waited for them to find me there whimpering as the grey sound swallowed every trace
                                                                                                  even still
                                                        I can feel it breathing, the light. Waking up. Remember.
