<a class="hidden" href="Aso-calledLastPoem.html">Ash</a> borrowings continued
the pain I long for replaced
the end of days
for an hour
ligatures impressed upon the soft skin
of women imprisoned in the arms of men

seized her by her hair
beat her till she tired of it
mocked by revellers
they hold me up to ridicule
I cannot restrain my sobbing
Do not be afraid, go now,
I will deliver you into the brighteness of day.

We have laboured in vain. 
I can see two apparitions dressed in white 
who accompany the maiden always and 
defend her from all assaults.

The mightiest men have hitherto bowed with reverence before the saint. 
Why did they thus bow?
