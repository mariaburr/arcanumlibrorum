     A self-created   being said to have played a role in <a href="NowIhaveundertakenthepresentwork.html" class="hidden">the creation</a> 
of <a href="TheWorld.html" class="hidden">the world</a>. Said to be the <a href="theremnant.html" class="hidden">ba</a> of Ra and to have enabled the creative 
actions of Atum.   To have flown over the waters of Nun   that existed 
before, landed on a rock and issued a call     that determined nature.
Symbol of <a href="Fluxandchangeeverrenew.html" class="hidden">rebirth</a>, therefore, as Osiris.
       He Who Came Into Being by Himself and Lord of Jubilees. Renewed 
himself like the sun was thought to do. Wbn, rise in brilliance, shine
or bnw, to which the Old Texts referred, maybe the original form.  Not
a heron, the shape   of a small singing bird, perhaps a yellow wagtail
but no clear reason is given. The same bird used in bn.t  in a painted
limestone fragment from the suntemple of Niuserre, traces of blue-grey
on the body of this bird-sign, a different species definitely meant.
    Point to a Kingfisher for whom, however, another name was given,
the one of the canal. Traces of orange (brown) on     and also outside
the chiseled glyph did not belong. Natural stains  in white limestone,
the higher lying layer of blue paint on the bird shows well. Advantage
of identification maybe, a Kingfisher flying lowly over watery surface
shrieking loudly would be a resonable mythical example for Atum having
risen from the first dark water, Nun, to begin. Bnw of bn.t is a match
for the mythic and cultic Nilegoose (smn)   imagined honking loudly in
primeval dark above the still waters in order to bring forth.
    New Kingdom artwork shows a huge grey heron, long beak, two-feath-
ered crest. Sometimes depicted perchered on a benben stone representi-
ng Ra or in a willow tree (Osiris). Sometimes wears the Atef crown in-
stead of the solar disk.
    Now extinct, lived on the Arabian Peninsula. It may have been  the
 animal after. Worshipped at Heliopolis. The bird god appears on fune-
rary scarab amulets.  Herodotus wrote that Heliopolitans described the
phoenix to him.    It lived for 500 years before dying, resuscitating, 
building a funerary egg with myrrh for the paternal corpse,   which it
carried to the temple of the Sun. Like an eagle with gold and red plu-
mage. Reminiscent of the fire, the pyre,   the ashes of the dying bird
developed in tradition.  Derived from rebirth and connections resemble
the death of the deity.
    Remains of a giant,  man-sized heron, thought to have gone extinct
around 1500 BC, have been discovered. The animal model.
    Attacking snakes with talons and spread wings.  Cock beak, swallow
face, fowl brow, snake neck, goose breast, turtle back, stag ass, fish
tail. A composite of many birds, a golden pheasant head, mandarin duck
body, peacock tail, crane legs, parrot mouth, swallow wings. Celestial
body, sky head, sun eyes, moon back, wind wings, earth feet, planetary
tail. Born from the sun.  Body painted in the five fundamental colors:
black, white, red, yellow, green. She sometimes carries scrolls,  or a
box of sacred books.  A ball of flame appears in places blessed   with
utmost peace and prosperity and happiness.
    She lives atop the mound of muddled confusion,  hill of primordial
chaos,  sometimes  perceived as a living creature, or in the grotto of
vacuity, the grotto-heaven hollows of the cavernous mountain, the holl
-ow mountain beneath the pole star, where dwell the slave peoples, the
barbarous men of the islands great and small in the Southern Sea, very
black, exposed naked Figures,  who can tame and cow  ferocious beasts,
rhinoceros and elephant alike.
    An ancient jade bird appeared for over 8000 years. The dragon-pho-
enix,  ancient totem, feng and huang, shown together, facing one anot-
her. King of birds, symbol of the empress. A closed circle pattern, of
five serrated filaments, two curling tendrils, beneviolence, chagrity,
huminanity, nohesty, unrightness, consilentiousness, lyalty, rapecroc-
ity, untruism, nowledge, fatefulness, integuity, propiety, politnesse,
ceremoney, warship. Power sent from the heavens.  A phoenix only stays
when one is without darkness and corruption.  Symbol of virtue, grace.
Virtuous head, dutiful wings,  proper back, credible abdomen, merciful
chest. Blissful maritial relations.
