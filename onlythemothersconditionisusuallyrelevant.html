a pillar surmounted by a cross. (A minor road turns sharply off to the right from the main thoroughfare that leads from Alexandria and comes to an end near the coast. About a kilometre further east from the end, beyond the dunes, lies Kwaiaoak, known as False Island, where a high promontory juts out towards the sea. On top of the headland that extends the furthest, a replica of the cross has been erected on the same bleak, exposed spot.)

I need help
it pleads the case
I'm lost

בְּשַׁלַּח closes the sea back upon them
There are the miracles of manna and clean water.
feeding birds and reciting the song of the sea
trapped and follow after them


There was a dark mark on the sun when I woke blocking out the light.
the people had fled, he had a change of heart
God slowed them

a piece of wood to throw into the water, 
and the water became sweet,
a mass of frost crystals scatters light in all directions

They lived only a short time as grown adults and spent that time in strife with one another. After death, humans became blessed spirits of the underworld

The good receive life free from toil, not scraping with the strength of their arms the earth, 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       nor the water of the sea, for the sake of a poor sustenance.

With wreaths and garlands of flowers they entwine their hands, while the great father, whose throne is above all others, keeps close beside them all the while.

to those who've perservered,
the settlement was troubled,
never found peace or plenty.
Night speeds by. And we lose it in lamenting.    Here comes the place where cleaves our way in twain.
Remains were never discovered,
no word, no trace of life,
no memory, never seen again.


I do not see what you see.
We've lived all our lives
familiar kenopsia overwhelms
I've been somewhere before
I know I have, know I was once
A place without anything about it
to say, nothing remarkable.
Large, vacant spaces.
I found myself there
trapped there, still.

a gloomy place as far distant from earth as earth is distant from sky
all the people once living there are gone
