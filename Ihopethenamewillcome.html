I hope the name will come.           To delay, 
         and finally remove 
         an impending danger. 
               Call upon the 
            unknown predecessor,     recommence 

the quest for the lost, unfinished.  Extinguished 
candlelight lingers in the shadow.   There be divers 

sorts of death: some wherein 
            <a href="theremnant.html" class="hidden">the body remains</a>, and in others 

it passes quite away with 
                                     the spirit. Another disturbance.  You remember being here? 

They were startled by the appearance. 
The anguished man rushed into the room. 
No more sign of her there than if never born. Consternation prevailed. Great search made, but no one to be found. After night and day in misery, the poor bridegroom laid down to rest. 
                                                                                                                                                 In a while he seemed to wake <a href="IneffabilisAmor.html#afterthedream">from a troubled dream</a>. 
                                                                                                                                                 The moon shone in the window. In the slanting rays 
                                                                                                                                                 she stood in white. His tongue was without utterance, 
                                                                                                                                                 
and limbs unable to move.
