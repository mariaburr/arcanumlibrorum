for a scathing reference   he suffered woes  been in sorwe 
to promise eventual return  in his heart

where he remained  on the seas
despite request to repatriate  he of which    conceit is obdurate
indicted for treason in absentia  everything  despite allusions to university, illness, incumbency
held in a reinforced cage         maybe said  the masses are dead
slept on dirt to open air  he snatched          I can't write about anything anymore...not this way

breakdown brought cot and pup tent   a pattern of grace                                the indolent luxury 
access to a typewriter  from small clauses and word clusters                           a single recycled image
a regulation-issue Bible             advancing by stages                               diving into brined wreck
a book of verse in the latrine    to achieve meaning, begins                           a knife, mermaid with crippled flippers
a eucalyptus pipe  of what an easy quick access, how suddenly                          a drowning, the vaunted hurt

men working a grape arbour         simple words simply arranged                        pounding the door
library inaccessible               carry military overtones
turned to inward materials  thou can'st no more not hear than die
                            constrained by nature to be
madman or traitor           accessible and eternal paradox

created too prolific
the sun's gone down 
men are to earth
overgiven lamenting

the loss of the exiled companions
number of dead friends gone
forgotten, they forgotten there 
on old swerving shore before,
a llonge bay fore  a rann a way
on raft blown by wind 

it can't be all
that we live on

the earth is old dust
out of stony rubbish 
what roots clutch, 
what crooked timber grown
you cannot say, or guess, 
you know: a heap of broken

images, vast shadow shapes 
on distant waves hear
anthems in strange tongues
salute, rejoice

nearby holy mountain
sorella la luna 
the thread then runs

Kuanon rising from the sea
forgives, rosy-fingered 
birds, a lizard, the clouds 
all that are are lights

seven-walled city of Dioce 
Wagadu, four times rebuilt
four walls, four gates,
four towers at the corners
four old men manned

longish moribund scene
encountered when rearrived 
beauty is differcult, refrain

more memories of America and Venice,
a rose of iron filings
drawn by magnets drawn
beneath the mirror,
celestial power,
fountain in moonlight,
hope for those who've past

over Lethe
mainly facsimile 
an ancient sang 
le chant des oiseaux
indestructible form 
preserved, transmitted,
conversations in the camp,
memories of Paris

ghost of life fore gone
details of revolution
further visions 

what was or may have been
destroyed in the war 
endured, exhumed and discarded
with tapers quenched 
along bank of river
bell, book, and candle

we are not so destroyed
eternal love may turn, 
while the ash tree retains 
her verdant blossom

in various guises 
again appears
Japanese dancer
Dublin hack
Aristotle
Yankee soldier

drunk invoke Zagreus
a glimpse of Ida 
so much familiar there 
are no righteous 
wars

birds perched
on wire fence 
meld to form 
fertile hymn

moon-nymph dispel
mortal doubt 
shadow of death
dawn woven through 
the black passage 

spirit, decline 
fleshiness and recovery
saved from sinking raft 
men of no fortune 
lamenting lost 
image nature 

ritual copulation
direct experience
still hidden at dawn
behind heaving breasts 
in the Pisan landscape

the other mountain
surrounded by vapors
surmounted by Venus
to break pentameter
the first heave 

memories of Spain 
words meant to sing 
heralds perhaps 
what well remains 
rest is dross

return to the camp 
inmates drown in earth
a word for weeping 
bird-notes seen 
a periplum 

not as land looks 
but as sea bord seen
correct geography
in midst a voyage 
one more night cross 
carry stars to shore 

mermaid carvings panta rei 
a Dryad speaks against 
cages for wild animals
tone placid underscore
don't help to grow

what will grow of itself 
weeping of remembered places 
wasp builds mud nest 
a long remembering pass age 
oh let an old man rest 
return from memory world 
the pressing present plight

a young man admired 
news of a death
woven through phrases
a double occurrence

death reviving
dead friends from war
te th ne ke 
a re prod u c tian

the swineherd's sister 
replies OK, they are 
the same, out of all 
this something must
come, at the core 
reappear chronometer
and closing sequence 

give thanks
night is spent 
hoar frost
grip lost 
a final note 
sang resign
despite return 
to the sphere
that marks most 

wet white paper 
fall apart bled 
away what words were 

unfit to face trial for treason
incarcerated at Elizabeths 
to entertain academics
the necessary hammering 
elucidates unreadable
fourtuan, found at 'eave end
rectitude, benevolence
everything opposes 

roots, grass, surviving traces 
cluster round the tree 
Erigena in close company
the sagetrieb Ocellus
emphasizes regeneration
imagines amalgamation
from no egg
dregs still

ut moveat, ut docceat, ut delectet
an aged couple offer hospitality
in the humble home
templum aedificans
not yet marble
font in hills fold 

for words
to speak themselves
sound stupid
foolish, beastial
barbarbar
I see
inscribed
in fleshy
medium
speak 
the dead 
a rise 
a waste 
a world 
a way 

to flee 
the labyrinth
the beast kept 

no passage to find 
a path must be made 
or is the trap 
escape
