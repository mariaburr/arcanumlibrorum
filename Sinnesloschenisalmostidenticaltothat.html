<body>Sinneslöschen is almost identical to that
the original has never been authoritatively located
based on a contested description

<a name="theauthor">The author does not make any claim
that it is an attempt to recreate
no matter how far your relationships vary
her eyes gradually becoming glazed over

similarly structured ominous choruses
cluttered before abruptly ending (clean work found on the likes)
typically ugly but nonetheless replete with harmonies
occasional ritualistic incantations
providing the ocean and wave

[he] live[s] in a castle or dungeon
in a quiet desert sanctuary
discovering more numbers than any one ever did
a reminder

one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods
rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert
they came later and did not live there

Does it matter at all that I ever was alive?
I do not like to think about my impending death.
another kind of some kind of living
normal play your turn you lose
until then each has a legal move to make
everything greater on one side and lesser the other

You can probably appreciate that
it doesn't stop
everybody stopped counting before they got to ω
you can't see it but you already know roughly what it looks like
they form an absolutely enormous world
occasionally I enter that daydream again
he died in a lunatic asylum

we talk about abstract nonsense
in no uncertain terms
everything is the simplest thing it could possibly be
all my life I've played games
and now and then
discovered something interesting
as a consequence

That's a wonderful thing, and it shouldn't be disguised the way it usually is.
