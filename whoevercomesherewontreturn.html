<body>whoever comes here won't return
a place of wonder ruled by the benevolent and mysterious
an empty city of ruins half-buried
shattered temples
the nothing found
that protects him from all harm

in search of an invisible <a href="theoracleofthedead.html">oracle</a>
chained and near death
imprisoned and left to starve

the residents leapt voluntarily into oblivion
long before being found
thanks to the irresistible pull of the destructive phenomenon
a distant roar of artillery
cries from the sea
</body>
