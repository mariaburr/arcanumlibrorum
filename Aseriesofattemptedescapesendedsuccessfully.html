His dress was shabby, though he attempted to keep his clothes clean and mended,                                                                                                                       like an offered bird
bereft through death or disappearance, abandonment or desertion, or separation or loss                                                                                                                         in the blessing beyond the eye
largely solitary                                                    do you not all know it?  and fear it,  and love it too?                                                                                 kept always in awe and fear and watchfulness                                         
after his father became crippled                                                            sometimes at least when at sea
                                                                                    What is the use of my praising the sea to you?
did not discover the whereabouts  of fishes and weeds and wonderful things
of tranquil flowered landscapes populated by children and fantastic creatures
originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts by the byways and drongs across the riged loam

dedicated every remaining day to composing  lately heard songs  the younger shrilling  shy-seeming so mute now rattles eaten by cankering care
a single-spaced fantasy manuscript
whose endless pages concluded: I had a very poor nothing like Christmas. Never had a good Christmas all my life, nor a good new year, and now... I am very bitter but fortunately not revengeful, though I feel should be how I am...

a branch of the most beautiful leaves and  magnificent  flowers,  saying, he will coll you,  bend, and sip                              bundles  of  flowers
"Take these, beloved, and offer them to the lady." You  turn your back   alone you take your track and scorn                     some   times renewed in mourning  a bed for repose  at the head a case for unguents and other odoriferous substances for perfuming the breath, new cut slices of lemon peel and such things

He pointed her out, sitting like an empress on a dais near the altar.
She held out the branch she had received.
The lady took it, broke off a sprig, and gave it back,
saying, "take special care of this for me."
