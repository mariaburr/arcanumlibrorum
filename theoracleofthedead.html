The Oracle of the Dead

I know I know I know and will   Never stay  the night.
Appear bedimmed aloft           The gloom   the great remainder,
Doleful blaze. Heap of strife,      Small slivered    glimpses subtend
<a name="theseas">The seas in quiet are  The keel of the future laid in late.
The Plague devoured.

The reported name of a person.  Waves roil  away     whatever
Indignation: a thousand years   Had been if anything had been.
Deemed amiss.    The light is   out.

Then followed quiet years. A derelict.   If they continue as they have
No records of the trading.         We shall find fine passage.
They did not proceed.             She entered    the Atlantic.

A small yawl               A salvor expected
Missing.     Such that I can hardly tell
                  What I am.
                                 I shall be.
Acquired material
From the original in Limbo.
Portrait of a fault area
Perpetually rent.

Portents bore revised legend,
A contemporary record.
Compounded difficulties,
We die.

Passing on reiterates.
He is loath to do.
Errors crept in.
Semiregular corrigenda.

To cull, thrash, to lie in rings,
Turn, to mount, to stir.
A selection, spiral,
The breech of a gun.
Disturbance.



This itself no longer.
This is not to be.
The past tense. To cry.
Sweetness, do we cry?

After this exile, 
Clement, loving,
Prepare the body,
A dwelling meet to commemorate,
Fervent intercession,
Delivered from death everlasting,
Resound!

A second separately bound,
Changes cemented,
Having “earned his rest.”

Man in the New World.
Spontaneous images and acheropites,
Simulacra, the common stream,
To revitalize, returning, passed.

“Toes no party line.”
Silence, you dogs.
Barefooted, sword-strapped
To restore decorum.
There is no record of a time.

A model of <a href="andyetbecame.html#orelse" class="hidden">elegant English</a>.
Another has now supplanted the deceased.



I did not need to appear.
Is it time to stop
Because I’ve reached the end,
Yes, I think I’d rather.

Exhausted before the beginning,
The form-giver, fallen
Disrepair carried on
Trapped in tangled threats, fate,
Assimilates the myth
To find the Truth,
Unmake the ancient flesh.

A vast landmass
In the southernmost sea.
A failed mutiny.
So man was born
From scattered stones.



Possibly forethought of fire
Savage offering, a burnt boy
Decreed the Age at end,
Deluge unleashed.

Volcanic promontory the boundary
The seat of feeling to be eaten again.

Strife of the fire-drill
Swollen with life,
Stole fallen starlight,
Roams the desolation
Enamored of women.
To him therefore ascribe
The whole crime.

Deeds befouled the earth,
Demonic offspring fight
Until they die.
Let some remain.

Incarnated vice
Derived from peels, shells, husks,
Spiritual obstacles,
Shells conceal holiness,
As peel the fruit.
The root of impurity.
False division in the Divine.

The peel protects the fruit.
Restrained from dissipation.
A fire infolding itself.
Initial catastrophe in Creation.

The pit of corruption,
Clanding cistern,
Clinging mud,
The lowest earth
Beyond the gates of death,
Demons of matter,
The adverse tree.

Deprived of life,
The sparks are free.



Experience difficult
Interaction restricted
Repetitive patterns
Cannot be changed.

What if true blossoms?
Beautiful dream.
He runs to the window.
She like a swallow
Longs for migration.

They too have gone.
She will remain home.
Then, on a whim.
She changed.

To begin a new life.
Living quietly by the sea.
Growing debts.
The child they may have.
A brief and disastrous career.
They cannot remain together.
Old life, devastated.

The deciding force departs
Without seeing.
The final act again,
Angry rebuke,
At the end left alone.

The war destroyed,
Restored surviving arrangements,
Revival added to the tragedy.



Hi Pop how you doing
Well we finally finished
How’s he been
Sat there since you left
Like everyday
Here’s my son
I talk to him
Can he hear me?
Why then begin at all?



Lord spoken in the Levant.
It was impossible to count them all their camels. 
Destroy the alter. The same symbol.
He appeared bearded.
