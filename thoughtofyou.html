<a class="hidden" href="whoevercomesherewontreturn.html">thought</a> of you
     stirs him so
        cannot be content
               he praises you

our hearts find no peace
until they find         rest
                in you
to occupy fully for the rest
of his life

after a thousand years
the fall of the city
prosperity depends not
upon propitiation of a miscellaneous array of gods

to save the body from desecration
it was re-interred

wretched creature
wearing the sign of his own sin
as thinking it will appear

I shall believe in you,
I shall look for you,
It is my faith that calls to you,
which you gave to me and made to live in me.

But how can such a gospel be <i>good news</i>
to surpass angelic powers
but people keep the spirit confined in flesh
they can overcome oblivion?

just as every life seems to end in tragedy
tormented with grief and doubt
suddenly terrified, the earth shook and brilliant light blazed around him,
first a child, then an old man, spoke, "I am the one who dwells with you alone"

remnants of the cross were recovered
a distance in the waste
reclaimed despite the loss of what once
gave life worth
as a harp its strings

there are plausible wolves in plenty
seeking to entrap the runners in the race
with perilous allurements
they will find no room among you solidary

Have nothing to do with poisonous weeds
the lone volcano divagated lustily long
a-caged exposed where periphery burst

he a-wake or a-sleep keeps quiet watch o'er empty tomb
a doom fortold he hold warm in womb
to grow a low burn to bright break
take what was into wasn't sake
along alarm an ache warded off rest
a destiny forewarned fate mourned in jest
