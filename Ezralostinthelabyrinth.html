of long age lost what was his only
blessing habits his own often
         at these moments of mourning greeting
                would break bad news in quite in different tones
                I rather fancy that you won't find a thing
               one day when he'd gone as time wore on
                gone out with a handkercheif and loaf of bread
               I am off to feed the peacocks he said somewhat absent-minded 
    though it did not imply a hope that I would stay, could certainly
    not be understood as expressing any real eagerness for my company
