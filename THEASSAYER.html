In which
with a most just and accurate
balance there are weighed the
things contained in
THE ASTRONOMICAL AND PHILO-
SOPHICAL BALANCE
<a name="Ihaveneverunderstood">I have never understood, 
Your Excellency, 
why it is that every one 
of the studies I have published in order to please 
or to serve other people 
has aroused in some men a certain 
perverse urge to detract, steal, or deprecate 
that modicum of merit which I thought I had earned, 
if not for my work, at least for its intention.
Have you ever seen a man?
I am at your mercy.
The fetters that bound him broke. The guards were perplexed.
Why did you do what you did?
It was wrong to punish the wicked.
Nothing remains of you. I go out
to the road and I listen to the foul landscape
sunk into itself, nothing glistens,
electric light breaks through the branches,
everything hushed like a much-hunted animal.
No matter where we go <a href="pastanerraticdeflectionfromintendedcourse.html#rearrive">we always arrive</a>
too late, flies stuck in amber.
