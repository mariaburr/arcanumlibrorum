siege guns  split     the silence in unison
sudden echoes     all the echoes  seize it quick smash it scatter it to the i n  f i n  i t  e  w  i n  d  s

in stark contrast to its value (and reputation)
found fine art  wanting
a t tempting to harness the ex traordinary tale nts of the very disp arate

that point where energy cuts into space and imparts form to it, the pattern of angles and lines in the disarray
juxtapositions of unexpected colour

potentially more saleable recognisable subjects
not to be lightly abandoned
a failure to rekindle a flame of adventure
auctioned and dissipated to now untraceable purchasers
presumably in America

largely forgotten until a spat
hampered by the absence
travelled in a tramp steamer around the south Atlantic and the Mediterranean to convalesce
disapproved of bright colours
the placement of surprising and incongruous elements
improbable and deliberate anachronisms

generally used to mean makes no sense
