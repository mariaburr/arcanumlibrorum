<body>A so-called "Last Poem" (Dernier poème) has been published numerous times; it was even set to music by Francis Poulenc in 1956. However, this poem never existed. The belief in its existence started after a misunderstanding. <a name="verybeginning">This is the very beginning of the book. The very beginning. Tell me, is anything? This very moment?</a> A great lake of pitch. A dismal, plaintive voice. <a href="bennu.html" class="hidden">A self-created being</a> said behold the world. The creation. He commends himself. Of the actions  before, the creative, that existed, that determined nature. Forbidden from making any changes, they do nearly nothing but alter from the start. Once past the prolegomena, digressions overwhelm the tale in length, in forcefulness, in imagination. <a name="stranger">A person besides, as far as I can observe, not at all regarded or thought on, wholly free from that slavery.    I am altogether </a><a name="thebook">a stranger. I do not fear the book at all.                                                     </a>
They divined in him—and as it were behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance—the superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation; a suspicion: such enormity of self-negation not coveted for naught—they have said, inquiringly. You, whoever you are. Behold. Hidden beneath these seething black waters, all the dismembered parts of her murdered husband. His penis was eaten by a catfish, or perhaps a crab. Gather together whatever remains. Know not how this will end. He cannot see or imagine where he will land. Among the flowered fields of Elysium? In the bowels of Leviathan? I should now at the same time be very unwilling. I should celebrate your liberality towards all men, and I mean myself. And I was just going on in the usual method to peruse a hundred or two pages and transcribe an abstract   but I was  diverted by a certain accident. Song of the infinite among the intricate branches. Anything different? No? 
He had found life less easy. He had been concerned only to echo the sounds he heard, after which his work was over for the day. The little house was whitewashed and showed no more than two quite simple windows, but across their balconies Virginia Creeper and a riot of yellow flowers had laid a pattern and hung in delicate airy swags. At this moment a peacock perched upon the roof displaying glittering colours, just as a hundred miles away the sea must be under no less radiant a sun, providing the richest and most marvellous ornament imaginable. At the bottom, contemptible Opinion of every Thing. Excessive front matter and series of digressions throughout. But you know, he could go hours the way he's been doing what he's doing. What about it? You see how grey he is. You get used to it. Remains of a giant have been discovered. Sing, firebird. A burning bird from a faraway land, both a blessing and harbinger of doom to its captor.
Who would pierce nature's <a class="hidden" href="Eherthefollowingwinter.html">secrets?</a> You have leapt over men in order to come upon nothing at all, as illustrious as unhappiness. Forced them to draw lots, the lucky man at once set about having a number of documents prepared on various subjects, sealed with the king's seal, with instructions to read them aloud, in case they might be willing to act against their master. When, therefore, he noticed they regarded the documents with respect — still more the words they heard read — he ordered the guards to refuse service. There the sky seems. He sees a plead—a pleasant wooded glad of green. His ears are lulled by the song of birds amid the interlacing branches. There is no single, consistent narrator in the work. However, if there is no single character posing as the author, then it is at least clear that nearly all of the "personae" are so much alike that they function as a single identity. In general, where a modern reader would view the book as consisting of dozens of impersonations, even hundreds, or a single one, it is written through the pose of a Modern or New Man. The book is that ship threatened by a great sea monster. The sailors might toss a tub overboard to divert the attention of the beast. A faulty allegory, the narrator is either a madman or a fool. 
He had a great many too many. He was a creature of habit. He had arrayed his ornaments and habiliment and passed the afternoon in talk with his friends and acquaintance. The evening given over to singing. The atmosphere grew uneasy. In this respect the day resembled all others. Representations have sadly diminished. This sort of thing had gone on for thirty five hundred years and there have been no disastrous consequences. Amen! Amen!                                The work made notorious, mistook for profanity, effectively disbarring its author from proper preferment. The tale itself comprises an allegory of three brothers as they attempt to make the world along various digressive passages interspersed throughout. Clear waters glide over fine sand, sifted gold. Here another disorder. Alternating fragments glitter, combine to create a varied composition imitating Nature. Then suddenly the distance appears. I should never finish. And then she first among them. The past is ended. Resplendent. Unfading. Found. 
Started work as an amanuensis. The first poems to appear in print were published in the Tribune of the Young. He developed a particular talent for automatic writing. He composed the loveless nights with curious solitude, lyrical outpourings of sexual delirium. Condemned by the ox who once declared him a prophet, he joined the acephalous in a corpse. An easy target for an incendiary tract. The gilded mediocrity, expelled for literary coquetry of the worst kind, a rigid disdain for literature as opposed to poetry. You get used to it, don't you. It's all right! You did good, and you're doing well now. You do what you need to do and we'll be here for you. We'd like it to be over but you do what you need to do. Feel like you could stop if you wanted to just be done, and that would be okay. It's impossible. The Indestructible Object, a mass-produced product that might be commonly found in many homes, reconfigured as it was marred, worn, missing, mechanism in fair working order, intended as a silent witness. Cut out the eye of one who has been loved but is seen no more. Keep going to the limit of endurance. With a hammer well-aimed, try to destroy the whole at a single blow. He had always intended to destroy it one day. The reign of the negative is over. They were gone. At that point the police appeared, late but ardent.
The eye of the sea. Out of focus. Diffused and textured, walking along a road, such charming things, where the female alters herself, that one outght to see them only in a dream or the instant. Beautiful? Retire to the bedroom, undress, bid her farewell. The male leaves the house. We are forever lost. In eternal darkness, the desert Eternebre. After all. How beautiful she is, after all. If flowers were made of glass, a few still appear again, the star, various rotating objects, beautiful, beautiful as a glass flower, a flower of flesh and blood, one must strike the dead, the cold dead, as they ascend and leave the starlight behind. And if you find on this earth a flower of fire, the sun, a nightingale nestledin a mourning veil, you are not dreaming. We return to the female reclining in the bedroom. How beautiful she was. How beautiful she is. The incarnate loss of love, a farewell elaborated as intertitles. It would be completed in time for his return. 
Not a movement. Motion itself. Perpetual motion. You are demonstrating against history. The grand old man was delighted. Isn't it wonderful? he murmured. The indestructible nature of the original idea. The difficulty of destroying all. Do not destroy. Detur Dignissimo. A draped female figure holds a lyre in her left hand, crowns a student. Cupid sounds a trumpet above both. Reverse, reverse. Please follow otherwise, accept, and read more. I called at a poet's chamber in an alley hard by, showed him and desired his opinion as to what the Author could mean. He told me after some consideration that it was a thing he abhorred, with no small hazard and weariness. I climbed a prodigious flight of dark winding stairs to find some meaning not of my own invention. In two days he brought me ten sheets of paper filled up on every side. There was not a syllable there but what I and everybody else knew as well as themselves. The Author stole and transcribed every word from the universal report of mankind. If I could make the same materials serve for another purpose, as my betters have done, it would help to make up my loss. You wake up and don't <a href="anoldsalve.html#knowthen" class="hidden">know who you are</a>. Everything aches. You know you did something, or somebody did. Sometimes it takes a while for the dream to fade away. 
He died in the small fortress, an inner part of the walled prison town, a month after the liberation. Even in those grim circumstances, a shift in perspective could create startling change. I am thinking of a story I heard years ago from a friend who survived. The mood is somber. No one can speak at all. Even the guards fall silent. But the silence is soon interrupted by an energetic man who jumps into line and grabs one of the condemned. Oh, he says, I see you. He is exuberant, and his excitement is contagious. First one man, then another, offers up his hand. The mood of the prisoners changes. That of the guards does too. How can one explain it? Perhaps a shadow was planted in their minds. Death no longer seems so inevitable. They are so disoriented that they are unable to go through with the executions. So all the men are taken back to the barracks. In a strange, tragic way his verses were fulfilled. I dreamt so much about you. Fate gave concrete meaning, the only one found with him. The poem started to cease to exist. The story behind the book's creation: long, narrow verticals, familiar shapes, an unusual emphasis on texture. I was instantly attracted to an emotional lushness in contrast with the cool surface of so much work. When you read how they came to be before long, plans put on hold because of the War, imprisonment, he died shortly after his release. It was his first work in prose, but remained unpublished. A description of a dream, I see myself, mourning for mourning, bathing with Andromeda. I greet the stars as they descend. And you wait a little longer. You don't recognize anything. You think you're somewhere other than you are. A transition from one state to another. It breaks off, fades, nothing takes its place. 
I dreamed of you so long. Does time remain? To reach your breathing body, to kiss your lips and hear your dear voice come alive again? I held your shadow, I bent your shape, I faced the haunting form that governed me for so many days and years. There is no more time for me. I sleep. Forms of life and loev and you, some passerby. I've dreamed too long, walked far, spoke my voice to a hoarse rasp. You and I become phantoms among phantoms. As far and bright as stars. You are my silent sea. Cruel flower of the mushroom bed. The stills are singing. The hour has fallen. You are ever-present torment, the island that turns aside when ships pass. The star enclosed in glass. Whyy don't you go back to your book? Maybe tonight I can read som more. How are you feeling? You all right? You are so far from me. Far away a house has just been built. A bricklayer sings a sad little song and suddenly, in the mortar, the future of the house appears. How happy I am, how strong and proud I am to leave the universe. The world has yielded to me. And you, beautiful, unyielding, are my prisoner. I yield to you.
