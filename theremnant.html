Heqet or Meskhenet breathed into them at the instant of birth the part of the soul that made them <i>alive</i>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     key to surviving death in the nether world,
A second image dwelling in a soul house, a doubleworld, a dominating concept of the next life in a less pure form. It lived into the middle days and lost much but always remained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                a necessary part of judgment  if it weighed  more than a feather,
Everything that makes one unique would live after the body died as a human-headed bird flying from the tomb. One form that comes into existence after death is corporeal—eating, drinking and copulating. The idea of immaterial existence was foreign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              carefully preserved           the monster Ammit immediately ate 
In another mode of existence the deceased participates in life outside the tomb in non-corporeal form each night. Impressiveness, power, and reputation intervened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        and stored, a scarab secured above  devoured the soul

A shadow or silhouette, šwt, is always present. They surmised a shadow contains something of the person it represents. A thin, black, featureless form, yet nonetheless existing still. An ostrich-feather sun-shade.

Reanimation was only possible if the proper rites were executed
and followed by constant offerings. The ritual made a dead person into a sort of ghost or roaming dead being (when the tomb was not in order anymore).
It could do either harm or good to the still living, depending on circumstances causing nightmares, guilt, sickness. It could be invoked by prayers or written letters left in the tomb's offering chapel in order to help family members by intervening in disputes, appealing to other dead persons or deities with the authority to influence affairs on earth, but also to inflict punishments.

Separation and unification were brought about after death by having the proper offerings made and knowing the proper, efficacious spell, an afterlife quite similar to normal physical existence—but with a difference. At night the Sun descended into the underworld and met the mummified Osiris. Together, they rise to new life for another day. The body of the deceased was his personal Osiris. His tomb was his personal underworld. He is often addressed as Osiris. Some sort of bodily preservation was required to allow him to return, to rise to new life in the morning. The complete were thought to appear as stars. Do not die again in the underworld. This death is permanent. Grant memory always.
but there was an attendant risk of dying again.

Your life happening again, without being kept away from 
your divine corpse, you shall emerge again each day and 
return each evening, a lamp will be lit for you   until
the sunlight shines upon your breast. You shall be told: Welcome! Welcome into this, your house, the abode of the living!
