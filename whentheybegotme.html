                                            I wish, when                 much depended upon              the very cast of mind,        steps over
                                            they begot me,               what they then did,             might take their turn from    the world,
                                            they’d duly consider’d how   that possibly happy formation,  the humours and dispositions  in low and ludicrous light,                  
                then uppermost.             I should have made quite     a different figure              in the world. Animal spirits  injured,
 transfused from father to son,             different tracks and trains, take my word.                   away they go cluttering,      in his way alone!
 believe me good folks,                     treading the same            nonsense, the                   and again, make a road of it.    
 A man’s sense or his                       to wind up the clock?        Nothing.
             Have you forgot                Since the creation of                                         <a href="aconnectionoropeningbetweenthings.html" class="hidden">Scattered    and             dispersed</a>, journey’s end

                 your father say?                   that I can see.      destined for his reception,                           a Being of activity  prey to sudden starts,
