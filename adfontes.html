<body>    A pseudonym made numerous. Regarding calamitous events beyond, uniformly inaccurate. Early messages tended to be short. 

<i>I didn’t know you were writing.</i>

    He tore up the letter. 

<i>Guess what? You’re lucky, did you know? If you only knew.</i>

    Left him half dead on the floor. 

    Also made due to shortcomings at the time. Reproduced, rearranging into narratives, not all refer. 

<i>Once, and another time too, I’ve been told.</i>

<i>You’re still too young to ask.</i>  

    Involved with the assembly, lost in future war, remained unexplained in his time.

<i>You don’t even know how to talk yet.</i>

    He acquired his form of address from the barbarian bacchic cry. 

<i>The rider god of the open air has been located.</i>

<i>Who is the God? What is his name?</i>

<a name="twogods"><i>The two gods were worshipped as one.</i>

    A stationary mass. When it rains the grass is going to grow. His word meant nothing. He suddenly began to feel very unwell.

<i>Rely upon him to think. Embrace revels, transfigure repressive weight. Efflorescent new life. Delicate recklessness. The obsolete suffering. Sclerotic works educate us. The din harmonious, gleeful chronicle skewered. The rest, tempest. The mostly subterranean occasion. Only a laurel. To feel a better fever, soon a negative result. Dig through the garbage.</i>

<i>I wasn’t really ready.</i>

<i>You should get sick. This is not the beginning.</i>

    The beginning is as follows. Afraid to stay longer, he surrendered. He could have come by sea. Any sound could penetrate without uttering a word. He wasn’t seen again. Where had he been? Bought and thrown away the same day.

<i>You could sort through this by yourself. Keep everything.</i>

    It would be so tiresome to lie in bed all the time. A halt in the middle, still, stared absently. He didn’t move. This went on for a time. He awoke, abrupt start, feigned he had contemplated making this start, alone in the room. He lay there all alone laughing to himself. He doesn’t even understand the reality of this. Then his face grew serious again.

    They were brief. They were unsigned. Two candles cast an unwavering light. Irritating and magnificent. Even the author admits it is unreadable. Or enormously readable. An erosion that continues yet.

<i>I had conspired to ascend. Those atoms that in their infinite supply and innumerable but finite recombinations comprise the universe, self-aware as words on paper, a document imitating other sorts of documents, especially letters mislaid, misdelivered, misread or miswritten, intercepted, purloined. Dear dwindling diversion, measureless inventory of passions, situations, speculations, flights of fancy reducible to inkmarks. Work all of this in.</i>

    She obliged. The meaner decade waited. Contagious enough to keep working. Fit midpoint of the road itself. 

<i>I am numb.</i>

    Time began then, at long end. At first spoke of a number, glistening in heaven. Soon, drifted.

<i>Did you bury a suicide?</i>

<i>I can't say.</i> Refused to say. I was unconcerned, uninvolved. The ache in my arms made them difficult to lift. What was there, to write? About what? I tried, I did. Plunged in headlong. <i>You know that, I know you do.</i> And yet, what can be said? Refracted light, broken to splinters.

<i>But why?</i>

<i>Because it is over now. Our century made superfluous. An empty place, where we are and belong. People think, they begin, they end. Where do we go now? Into the pages, the endless empty pages, the dust and waste. Where we're forgot.</i>

    He couldn’t understand what we would gain, he thought madmen, must be. That religious feeling, the decline into other.
