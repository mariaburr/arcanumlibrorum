now more than Five Thousand years since our World was made
to recollect and view at this distance the face of the Earth when fresh and new
the speculation so remote it seems hopeless
beyond the reach of Humane Wit

We the last Posterity of the first Men 
fain into the dying Age

by what footsteps, by what guide, can we trace back our way to the first order of things? 
Divine Providence should not be willing to keep Mankind finally and fatally ignorant of that part of Nature which is properly their Task and Province to manage and understand. 
We are the Inhabitants and Lords and Masters of the Earth,
endowâ€™d with Reason and Understanding
to examine and unfold the works of God 
our heritage and habitation.

And it will be found, it may be, upon a stricter Enquiry, 
in the present constitution of the Earth, 
there are certain marks and Indications of its first origin; 
the first Chaos, Paradise, and universal Deluge, 
we may discover, by those Lights, what was, 
and what Changes have since succeeded.
