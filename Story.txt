Ergodic literature
Threads of story run throughout, unravel and go in different directions,
fray into loose ends, tangle up or become knotted
Vellum
Palimpsest
Nested and intersecting frame narratives



Major threads
- GOFP
--- GOFP was not the work of a single author, but of a dispersed society of 
mutually anonymous participants (related to the CRAFT Club). 
The goal is not to create a labyrinth
but to escape one. The events of the story are part of the novel, the
characters are stuck in the story.
They believe that all literature, all language, is bound up with this
labrythine creation, existing above all to dissimulate it.
All existing works of literature conceal pieces of the labrynth, which
are concealed precisely in being made to appear as parts of some simple
linear presentation. These elements can be freed from this disguise not
simply by being taken out of context, but by then relating them to
one another, thereby revealing a secret subtext buried beneath all
text, literature itself having a palimpsest character. This is what
they sought to do, to work out this secret subtext, the labrynth underlying
all literature, language, meaning, and to thereby find a way out of
the labyrnth.

- Library of Babel
--- The labyrinth contains courtyards, each of which is a self-consistent
literary world. This world may be fictional or real, but in every case, it is
real for itself. It is defined by everything consistent that can be written
about it. Each of these texts, and each of their variations, is contained
in the rooms surrounding the courtyard, with the more distant rooms containing
more distant variations (whether semantically or syntactically). The
courtyards are thus organizing principles for the library rooms.
- Yet how a text is read depends upon the language, first of all, and upon the
limits of reasonable variation defining the courtyard-worlds, both semantic
(what a given world contains) and syntactic (the noise-limit within which
a given content is effectively conveyed).
- The librarians set about moving the texts around to build the courtyards.
- The library does not exist only on a single level of adjacent rooms (2 dimensional).
There are n-dimensions. The floors up and down define the length of the books,
but there are innumerable other axes defining other parameters, like lines
per page, characters per line, and characters available. These dimensions can
be accessed via trap doors.
- There is also a meta-dimension in which all finite parameter sets (books 
of 1 to n pages) occupy one place, and ascending infinite ordinals taking
over from there (books with different orders of infinity for a given parameter)
This is whever the book of sand came from.
- All the books in a room bordering a courtyard are thus volumes of an
encyclopedia exhaustively defining that world.

- Prologue by a historian a la Don Quixote, also Canterbury Tales

- The traveler, who stands in for the reader, goes on a pilgrimage to an ancient city after receiving a letter from Clara (Beatrice). He encounters an old man on the side of the road. Dante and Virgil, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, Jacques and his Master. Prometheus and Cleanthes.
--- His journey modeled in part on the Odyssey, and in the structure, recounting the journey afterwards, but also still in the middle
--- Others join them on the way. Canterbury Tales.
--- They must take refuge from the Desolation, and tell stories to pass the time. Decameron.
--- They tell stories to each other, their own backstories and other tales, which begin to overlap, with stories being told at multiple levels. Tristram Shandy.

- Like One Thousand and One Nights, the main story is being told to a would-be executioner to stave off death
