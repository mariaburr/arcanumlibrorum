<body>Lee made gunshot paintings

the son of a mechanic 
from a prominent family of English ancestry,
worked with machines while still small
witnessed a green reindeer apparition in the woods
and ghostly grey figures play beside his bed

the perishing place
revolved around telepathic mind-control
where spindly sons of the rich transformed into manly specimens
which was stressful for him
displays of affection considered embarrassing

took a job as a clerk in a bank
long hours reviewing ledgers for errors  (the adding machines would sometimes give outrageous answers)
boredom and monotony weighed heavy
damaging his health

he had a natural love for mechanism
accuracy his foundation
no ordinary materials were good enough
metal plates could not expand or shrink by the smallest fraction of an inch
hardened tools, sharpened to fine points

held a string of uninteresting jobs
picked up young men in steam baths in Vienna and moved in a circle of exiles, homosexuals, and runaways
his mental health became a concern after he deliberately severed the last joint of his left little finger at the knuckle to impress a man with whom he was infatuated
stabbed a man to death in a drunken fight, in self-defense by some accounts
a testament to latent talent

the gun had fired accidentally
so said bribed ballistics experts
<a href="Duringlongyears.html#knowledge">what kind of knowledge have the dead?</a> 
<a href="memorypainsme.html">do you remember us?</a>

no one held responsible for the fire that burned the last traces of the world away
exposing him to a malevolent entity, the invader, the Ugly Spirit
I live with the constant threat of possession, a constant need to escape from possession, from Control
maneuvered into a life long struggle
and dreams are likewise wicked things

<a name="appallingconclusion">the appalling conclusion:
no choice but to write my way out
writing a form of sorcery to disrupt language, acquisitive evil, Ugly evil

overseas at a loose end
unable to live in the cities toward which he was inclined
decided to head for Interzone
a city where drugs were freely available
an environment that synchronized with his temperament and afforded no hindrances to his interests and indulgence in chosen activities
rented a room, began to write a large body of text
slid together with little care
a book that could be cut into at any point

discovered a port of entry
what would have otherwise been the bleeding remains of a man
a glistening vacancy where time once was
a thread pulled loose from the fabric
the tapestry now nothing

a random or mechanical basis for text generation
no writer as creator of a string of words
a straight narrative chopped up, leaving the reader to sort it all out
the manuscript in pieces, parts in no particular order
an outlet for material otherwise rendered unpublishable

former career criminal and cigarette smuggler
known to some as King Junk
arrested on suspicion of importing narcotics
time served dominated by occult experiments:
mirror-gazing, scrying, trance and telepathy
hands transformed into tentacles 
his whole image becoming some strange entity
visions of far-away places 
other people undergoing rapid metamorphosis

spearheaded a reputedly painless heroin withdrawal treatment
financed by a reclusive acquaintance
in an attempt to place curses on people who had drawn his ire
outrageous and unprovoked and poisonous discourtesy 
the project lost traction
a lesson in never again.

<a href="Recordersofinformation.html">Record</a>. Take pictures. Stand around outside. Let them see me. They are seething around in there.
Their business fell off. They kept shorter and shorter hours.
You were giving out all this energy and nothing was coming back.
Billy began to vomit blood.

his brief marriage to a teenage waitress had disintegrated
their relationship was not spontaneous and lacked real warmth or intimacy
repetitive episodes of pederast fantasy and sexual strangulation
his father had poisoned his life
found near the side of a Florida highway by a stranger

rewrote episodes from history to reform mankind
overzealous if well-intentioned admirers frequently visited the Bunker
his job was to deal with the underworld beneath each city
a great ability to incorporate one-time outsiders
the priest, they called him

created abstract compositions by placing spray paint in front of blank canvas, then shooting the cans with a shotgun

decides to shoot up heroin and he takes out this utility belt full of syringes
we're laying around high and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table there's a letter from the White House. 'Hey, this looks important.' he replies 'Nah, probably just junk mail.' I open the letter and it's from the President, he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who the current president was.
became member of a chaos organization
believed in frontier individualism, our glorious frontier heritage of minding your own goddamn business
came to equate liberalism with bureaucratic tyranny, viewing government authority as a collective of meddlesome forces legislating the curtailment of personal freedom
I always say, keep your snout in the public trough.
had a number of Guns and Ammo magazines laying about, only very interested in talking about shooting and knifing ... I asked if he had a Beretta and he said: 'Ah, that's a ladies' pocket-purse gun. I like guns that shoot and knives that cut.'

there are no coincidences and no accidents
a cast of beasts that play upon the stage,
autophage, forget decay
Nothing happens anyway, unless someone wills it. The dogma of science is that Will cannot possibly affect external forces, that's just ridiculous, as bad as the church. My viewpoint is the exact contrary of the scientific. If you run into somebody in the street there's a reason. Among primitive people they say if someone was bitten by a snake he was murdered. I believe that.

magic tends to cause confused thinking
assertion of Will as primary moving force in this universe
the minute fraction of the universe we are able to contact
To me, this has always seemed self evident.
no death, no illness, no misfortune, accident, war or riot, no idle passing interest
Wreck hoard: the source of his writing...

behind everyday reality was the world of psychic visitations and phantom beings
writing itself had a magical purpose
political warfare, scientific research, personal therapy, magical divination, and conjuration
break down barriers surrounding experience
they do mean something, often refer to some future event
Perhaps events are pre-written and pre-recorded and when you cut word lines the future leaks out.

His grave lies to the right of the white granite obelisk.
Everything lost.

evil <a href="pastanerraticdeflectionfromintendedcourse.html" class="hidden">riverran past</a> the Composite City,
an attempt to create a mythology for the space age,
my education by a book of dreams,

had known a certain Captain Clark who once bragged he had been sailing 23 years without an accident.
That very day, Clark's ship sank, killed him and everybody else.
A bulletin on the radio announced the crash of an airliner in Florida.
The pilot was another Captain Clark and the flight was Flight 23.

Be a man! Be a human animal... be a superman! Be a superman.
a person devoid of anger, passion, indignation, hope, or any other recognizable human emotion
the day the riots began providing details on the creation of the fictional sequence

Once I woke up in the early morning light and saw little men playing in a block house I had made. 
I felt no fear, only stillness and wonder.
knew that I could never kill a reindeer
he thought he finally had the answer ... the unforgiveable slip had caused the death
If the Word was indeed the basic mechanism of control – the 'virus' by which The Ugly Spirit, or its agency Control, exerted its malevolent influence – then surely a real understanding of the Word, what words are and what can be done with them – was essential. All these explorations and obsessions were not merely diversions, experiments for artistic or literary amusement ... but part of a deadly struggle with unseen, invisible – perhaps evil – psycho-spiritual enemies.
Now if you start cutting these up and rearranging them you are breaking down the control system.

he did pursue a lifelong quest for spiritual techniques by which to master his unruly thoughts and feelings, to gain a feeling of safety from oppression and assault from without, and from within.
Once I looked in a mirror and saw my hands completely inhuman, thick, black-pink, fibrous, long white tendrils growing from the curiously abbreviated finger-tips
I literally turn into someone else, not a human creature but man-like: He wears some sort of green uniform. The face is full of black boiling fuz and what most people would call evil – silly word. I have been seeing him for some time in the mirror.
I saw Stern lose about seven pounds in ten minutes ... On another occasion he felt my touch on his arm across six feet of space.

Are not all writers, consciously or not, operating in these areas?
a kind of alchemy – magic based on precise and incantatory arrangement of language to create particular effects

witch hunts may have stemmed from misunderstandings of diseases
meticulous recreation of medieval scenes
graphic depictions of torture, nudity, and sexual perversion

A scholarly dissertation on the appearances of demons
large scale models are employed to demonstrate the structure of Hell
tempting a sleeping woman away from her husband's bed
dreaming of flying through the air

A long narrative broken up into several parts.
The old woman, after being tortured, admits to heavy involvement
vignettes about a somnambulist and a kleptomaniac
studying manuals, illustrations and treatises
He included a lengthy bibliography
I am against adaptations... I seek to find the way forward
confounded by boundary-crossing
absolutely unfit for public exhibition.

satanic, perverted cruelty blazes out of it, 
the cruelty we all know has stalked the ages like an evil shaggy beast, the chimera of mankind. 
But when it is captured, let it be locked up in a cell

young men and women, who have entered the enchanted world
holding the onlooker in a sort of medieval spell
seem to have stepped from primitive paintings
correlating ancient fears with misunderstandings

the Hammer of Witches
endorses extermination
and for this purpose develops a detailed theology
contributed to the increasingly brutal prosecution

death is the only certain remedy
