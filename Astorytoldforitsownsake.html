Most cannot follow singing 
            silly  songs 
                or talking business. 
                
        The fellowship is lost. 

Event set somewhere sometime 
            distant past. 
        
        The city was ruled by kings. 

An altar commemorated the abduction. They do not relate the tale but merely discuss it. 
Nothing is accomplished by telling  it, no immediate purpose. 
                   A story told for <a href="Theaim.html" class="hidden">its own sake</a>.
