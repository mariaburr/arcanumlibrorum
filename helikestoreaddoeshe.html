<a class="hidden" href="IfaMancannottearapage.html">he</a> likes to read, does he? hefted the bulky book&mdash;rubbish! Total, unmitigated gibberish.
would be a thousand pities to pry apart pages thick with such sick nonsense, to
parse them words wet with wonderous whatnot and whathaveyou, true stupidity that 
mighty unlike prose, too ugly to be poesy, like the output of a papershredder let loose on entire libraries
wastepaper, compacted wastepaper and books, smeared with letters looking like encyclopedias&mdash;and a good three tons of them 
a jug filled with water magic and plain; lean over, a stream of sewage flows out 
no telling where what comes from, when I read, I don't really read; 
I pop a beautiful sentence into my mouth and suck it like a fruit drop, 
or sip like liqueur until it dissolves, infusing brain and heart and coursing through veins to the root

Hold a moment, while I digest that sovereign contempt: I must make a shift to gulp it down.

Did she not faint away when seeing him lying breathless on the earth, turned pale when he became part of the field?
What else could occasion all her melancholy, that night at supper, the next morning, and indeed ever since?
was a good girl, would not fall in love, that made me angry. I was never more rejoiced in my life.

O, <span class="small">lord</span>, we are obliged to you for allowing us a capacity in anything.
But that's easily improved.
<i>Is</i> it? Not so easily as you think: been smouldering like that ever since lighted
I am in the downs. This unbearably dull, suicidal room...looks at the fire, observing him
altering the construction of his sentence
On business?
No. No business. Only sauntering by and stopped to prose.
So myserious and secret!
looks with real or pretended admiration round the room at the <i>Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty</i>
what it is about, and means to be about, to become acquainted with the most glorious destinies of mankind,
rumors are recirculating proximately, reverts from this intelligence implicated, seems to know the originals, and to be known of them
by a small light in his likeness quenched in a darkness, comes out of the dull room,
inherited the deal wilderness of desk bespattered with a rain of ink, is "very free" they say

There once disappeared great many things or men maybe unknown what, the ill-used tack and remonstrance missing 
No evidence left, smart in some aspects sloppy in others, nothing to trace so no mistaking it,
the bleak appointed time taken place as how so and what of it forget it for now come back around
the greatest heist in history: nothing remained afterward, and on nothing was rebuilt all now that is 
while here on earth or this facsimile let me be cloyed with all things that delight the heart of men,
in pleasure and dalliance time will pass away, in good fortune is my downfall destined
while this bright frame does stand, may be admired through the furthest land.
Come then, stand by me, and see all appear immediately.

We viewed the face of heaven, 
of earth and hell, 
so high our dragons soared,
appeared to me 
no bigger than my hand
in quantity,

we did view the kingdoms of the world
Viewed their triumphs as they pass away,
to make monks and abbots stand like apes 
point like antics at Pope and priest,
to beat the beads about friars' pates,
clap huge horns on cardinals' heads
but Bruno will burn: "Proud Lucifer,
I fall to Peter and not to thee."
