On the Ocean I discovered her standing nude and cold with seaweed colored skin where dead things live again
holding everything together, so to speak,
there beyond the breadth of all the earth, 
farthermost than all lands known or not,
beyond the blessed islands and the milkwhite sea,
beyond black sand beaches and pink stone slopes,
where night never lasts, waking fevered by the sleeping sun,
