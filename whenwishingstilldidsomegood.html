when wishing still
did some well

the sun itself marveled 
every time shone upon ur face

bene athan old linden tree
on edge off well 

to pass
time she'd throw 
golden ball hands held high

in the deepness disappeared
see no bottom

thus lamenting called
you'll turn stone to pity 
thick ugly old water-splasher
foul unclean spirit spewed 
from false beast mouth
swarms destroyeth, 
teem abundant in 'er chambers
smite all thy borders
be still and stop crying

pearls and precious stones
and even golden crown 

no, to sit beside you
eat from golden plate
drink from your cup 
sleep in your bed

in water sits and croaks with his kind
Brékkek Kékkek Kékkek Kékkek! Kóax Kóax Kóax!
Bákkhos row row Kóax Kharon on free further shore,
ourobulous danke the psychopomp

heavy with weeping revelry recall 
the foggy dew was sweeter far
libations unto each dead
bayleaves all aflutter

Misses mausey, I'm come to thee
To see if thou canst fancy me
Answer I'll give thee none
paces he's ernst as far as bloody awful
he would a walking go
with a roley, powley, gammon and heigh ho
I'll eat ol red Rowley's cap, maketh no 
freere than dyin I see us back a s'long ago
