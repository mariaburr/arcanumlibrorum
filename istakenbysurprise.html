<body>is taken by surprise, into vanishing at some distance lodged
                      the action becomes laconic, befuddled intent sounds dull, the murky disarray
                      no cruel lord with murderous blade,                       confused, morose, nigh to tears and memory most, nothing close to magia rhythmica interlaced throughout the volumes,
                      dying in music, else the air still,                                                                        endless passages, dark corners, witness to continuous construction, no woven web of bloody heraldries, but mossy dells for roving comrades made, this entirely visible city, familiar sea, rock, slate, brick, marble, perpetually working
                                      the brown bird has ceased yet one exquisite trill                                                                                                              starlight none, the room dark and tight like in a blurred coalpit                                                                                  against the mountain, American since Columbus. Prodigious boredom of Art. Conical hills topped off with sanctuaries, small bright teeth,
                                      about the sombre woodland seems to cling, to wander and wheel above the pines,                                                                                                 a pin-bright vein of quartz disturbs the depth of darkness                                                                                                                                                                                              alleys, countless children play, elementary prostitution, chestnuts, figs, golden pies, walking through the close, thick life of these deep lines like entering the sea, the dark bottom strangely populated, concentrated odors,
                                                                                to tell each tiny dewdrop dripping from the blue-bell's brimming cell.                                                               like subsoil roots, unsentried senses softly slept on guard, moon would have shown the beasts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   crawl upward, miniscule domes, unfamiliar combinations, a very old cuisine, a slate quarry, warm valleys where the tired student lies with half-shut book, many a winding walk across the trampled towing-path, a troop of laughing boys in jostling throng, the gossamer with ravelled silver threads
                                                                                In the dim meadows desolate to you remember? Do you hear the wild dogs at the gate?                                                                                                               the desperate vestiges of all the world were left                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               works at its little loom from the dusky red-eaved sheds, indelible evocation huddled on the sloping hillside, rising up from the bay, launched from harbor waters, utterly forgotten
                                                                                Sometimes, like today,                       Still by the light and laughing sea she bemoans his fate.                                                                                            because, after all, no one should kill himself, I see suddenly that the man was, in a certain sense, ill-fitting jacket and all,
                                                                                           thick fog lifting later on,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            humanity himself, if only for a moment, then he died, nothing more,
                                                                                           the clarity of a dream,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   yes, others do not exist...the sunset stagnates, heavy wings, colors cloudy and hard. The great river trembles, I don't see it run, it was made for me, a common grave, uncertain and silent
                                                                                           the cluttered far shore, hidden towns beyond the hills,
                                                                                                                    the land absolutely white, faces have no faces where I am, there a world after all,
                                                                                                                    the river glow,   a father feels for his own,                for a while, then the air obliterates
                                                                                                        worship a painted likeness,   everything in nature is eager to be,
                                                                            after a sojourn in heaven you will descend and be born,   like a bird to destroy the snakes, adversaries, fame like the moon,
                                                            you will conceive a desire to renounce the world, you must not despair.                                                   abandoned by my husband in the forest, do not worry about anything.
