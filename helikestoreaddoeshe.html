parse them words wet with wonderous whatnot and whathaveyou, true stupidity that 
mighty unlike prose, too ugly to be poesy, like the output of a papershredder let loose on entire libraries
wastepaper, compacted wastepaper and books, smeared with letters looking like encyclopedias&mdash;and a good three tons of them 
a jug filled with water magic and plain; lean over, a stream of sewage flows out 
no telling where what comes from, when I read, I don't really read; 
I pop a beautiful sentence into my mouth and suck it like a fruit drop,

There once disappeared great many things or men maybe unknown what, the ill-used tack and remonstrance missing                                                    for the abomination of Jehovah dispossessing them from they presence
