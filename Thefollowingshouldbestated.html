<body>The following should be stated at this point. 

It cannot resolve an infinite sea   of particles. 

                A hole in the sea. The solution, negative time evolution. A process that could continue without limit as  it approaches this point. But does the limit exist?   The function   is infinite. An infinite discontinuity. An infinite number of limits. Hold onto something that makes you feel secure.
                
it descends ever lower into the black. Lumbers on,     an anguished howl, a merciless battering. It decays into seething respite before the sludge returns, a gradual desecration, a rotting beast wallows  in the putrid froth. The black furrow.

Real people do not behave this way, being pledged to maintain the narrow lane, boundary unimpeded and free, a terminus,  and afterwards     derived ending,          the old mark. Star names are known. Some irregular constellation. An absolute order. They err who suppose the negation  I am urging refutes the isolated thing in the depths. Antithesis is constant, the relentless sensation of cold, spacious suppleness as I open the door and go out along the half-darkness of the street, a supplement that comes coupled to continuation, the other event.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The   dependent     outcome 
Reasons must be sought in the quiet ruined garden. Reason is often rejected, it does not behave as such, but rather as a marking that indicates as dependency relationship. You weep at everything, know naught of anything, and glory in knowing all.       Spurn the things of this world. I am foreign to none of this. I disdain, I know, I do not know, I pursue, I cry, I tyrannize. I am god, hero, demon, the universe. I am a man of the country. In certain words the man is changed, an ending added, but not all words.                     Non-occurence     of what  at such moments happened?  The present acquired the past.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        will occur,   will happen.                  
The center of the circle is concerned. A casting process, partly a result of having remained in bed for twenty years, voluntarily bedridden, occasionally rose for brief periods in the evening, lost all physical reaction to bad or good, trace changes by inactivity. The past is lifeless and inactive. The flow of time is not active within the past. It spills out at the boundary but quickly coagulates.                                                                                                                                has already occured. This gives us no information.

                Holes in this sea indeed occur, and are extremely important. There is an underlying positive that cancels out. These divergences do not require  a preexisting space-time. All structures therein arise as a result of collective interaction with the addition    of holes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   he would  call them, and whatsoever   Hence,  he  is  their   names

There was an interruption, I recall. He perceived the shadow. He smiled without reason in the twilight. Good evening to you.
    
The voice from the edge long out of print. <span class="white">Take great care to pause, or the listener might become confused. Interruptions in logical order are often caused by reversible words. A bold wellow written in yet another hand at the top of the opening page remains puzzling. Nothing can be determined. This my resolve. I continue. The ground is broken. Straddle the fissure. This work far surpasses those which we’ve hitherto seen. Mold, bees, lice, eels. Reluctant to publicize his findings, but society urged him to be more confident. He preferred to work alone, distrusting the sincerity of those who offered assistance. Soon relations became severely strained, his credibility was questioned, existence entirely unknown. Even given his established reputation as a reliable observer, his account was met with skepticism.</span>

Other delusions, almost entirely. 

Time is strictly regulated. 

Everyone must do everything. 

Time is revoked. 

He is never on time. Hunt for him. He decides not to stop. He was wrong before. A primitive statement. I gave a low moan of exhaustion. Go under. Numberless number the dead, thousands sink as I rest. We sang then. Now all are gone. All gone under. I do not. A torment. So far as I can see, merely to perish, soon or late, miserably sustained, to reach the Shore.

No more night, no more sea. No matter. We begin at sea in the dark. Blind habit. I have joined the cheers and songs, and passed along to other pleasures and diversions, despise my weak vitality, the freedom I reject, responsibility for senseless circumstance. Brothers, fools, sages, brutes, nobodies, numberless all.

She may have foreseen some of not what I would, a curious sense. I must be impaired when I read, which I never do. True, I am still a useful member of society, deprived of life, I don’t know what they call it, untrue, nothing resembling however the stars at night, the only light I can abide.

Morose, generally opposed to humanity, she puts me in that category.

Elements of the landscape.

I am beginning to be.

I will never get away from here. 

I will never get back. 

I must not give up hope. 

A space of time stuck somewhere. 

Somehow I never could, there must be a binding spell. 

Some time I shall find. 

I contemplate the song. 

I stayed so long here. 

All this is digression. 

If I ever appear now, in the nature of a spectre, a relief. 

Everything depends upon how a thing replaces an apparent reality. 

Nobody came, of course. I do not know for how long a period. 

A question about that madness. 

Look at the river, flowing past the citadel, to the sea. 

I have forgotten the name.































He recorded the deviant      speech  and also     the intended utterance, which was lacking. 
Who clearly cannot cross the boundary to reality? A diminished functioning in which abstract 
    reasoning            is localized.              Individual ideas   are expressed instead of 
general ideas.           Among these he included    the proper names.  What is   the current view 
 of the last disorder?                            I  no longer think   that error in speech should be 
  necessarily equated with the result,               quite different,     a true    deficit, a failed 
                            intention,              intricate errors,             difficult to analyze, 
              playing a marginal role.              It may be planned and regulated by the human speech. 

Recent research has confirmed a fundamental disturbance. 
       In the book of dreamed   literature, heard or read words which they awakened later, poetry rather than 
                        prose or   fiction,                       except one or several word phrases, and then 
          the flowers   came.               Look.           But she never knew the difference between real things and not. 
                        There was nobody to look after.         She  only  had time 
                                  to say.
