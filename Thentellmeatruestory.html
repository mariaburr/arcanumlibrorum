<body>Then tell me a true story, Ἀληθῆ διηγήματα, what of the <a href="thenarrativeendsbeforetheseeventstakeplace.html" class="hidden">true history of the world</a>, of nature and the rest of man?
Can the truth speak for itself? 
Words don't lie.
                 But people do.
Ought we take them at their word, that the're people?
What else then?
                outlandish tales, presented as if true
by whom?
         Perhaps the tale tells itself. The reader a fantastical double of the narrator that disappears when the book is closed. A figment of imagination. The imagination itself is what's real, and what is imagined, less so. The story is not at all "true"; everything in it is a complete and utter lie.
Well then?

Lucian and his fellow travelers journey out past the Pillars of Heracles.
Blown off course by a storm, they come to an island with a river of wine filled with fish and bears and trees that look like women.
Shortly after leaving, caught up in a whirlwind and taken to the Moon, where they're embroiled in full-scale warfare between the king of the Moon and the king of the Sun over the Morning Star.
After returning to Earth, the adventurers are swallowed by a 200-mile-long whale, in whose belly they discover a variety of fish people, against whom they wage war and triumph. 
They kill the whale by starting a bonfire and escape.
Next, they encounter a sea of milk, an island of cheese, and the <a href="onlythemothersconditionisusuallyrelevant.html#islandsoftheblessed" class="hidden">Island of the Blessed</a>.
They find sinners being punished, the worst having written lies and fantasies, including Herodotus
Then deliver a letter to Calypso given to them by Odysseus explaining that he wishes he had stayed with her so he could have lived eternally.
discover a chasm in the ocean, sail around it, discover a far-off continent, decide to explore it
future adventures will be described in upcoming sequels (a disappointed scholiast: "the biggest lie of all")

satire against sources which quote fantastic events as truth
what did surprise me was their supposition that nobody would notice they were lying
exaggerated to ridiculous ends to mock the original tellings
things I have neither seen nor experienced nor heard tell of from anybody else; things, what is more, that do not in fact exist and could not ever exist at all. 
So my readers must not believe a word I say.
the only truthful story ever written, as it admits it is all lies.

All things come to their fulfulment despite the rival nature, containing her from without or contained within, or even existing apart and detached from her infinite body. The vulgar confine their admiration to the elementary, the inorganic coherence, timber and stone, groves of figs and vines and olives. When meat and other dainties are before you, you reflect:
