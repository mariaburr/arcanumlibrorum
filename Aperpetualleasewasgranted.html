A perpetual lease was granted and did not carry any rebate of rent or obligation of improvement
so long as the lands remained the tenants could not feel secure

emphyteutic or perpetual lessees should have enjoyed complete security of tenure so long as they paid
rent punctually, but in practice their position was precarious. There were moreover many suitors for gifts of crown lands whom the emperor wished to oblige. Lessees were
immune from <i>extraordinaria</i> and <i>munera sordida</i>. They were excused the levy of recruits if they paid commutation. Yet
even these protections failed to prevent extralegal expropriation.
