whoever comes here won't return
a place of wonder ruled by the benevolent and mysterious
an empty city of ruins half-buried
shattered temples
the nothing found
that protects him from all harm

in search of an invisible oracle
chained and near death
imprisoned and left to starve

the residents leapt voluntarily into oblivion
long before being found
thanks to the irresistible pull of the destructive phenomenon
a distant roar of artillery
cries from the sea
