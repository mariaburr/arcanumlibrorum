The aim: to reconstruct the idea by extrapolation from a wide variety of sources, literary and visual. 

<a href="Ezralostinthelabyrinth.html" class="hidden">The labyrinth</a> of the idea: imprisoned  in artistry, 
            it is not true, universal, immutable, 
            it is subject to temporal  change, 
                      the most marked  change, 
                      the presence of 
                                false  turning 
                         and repeated  choice. 
                         But there is  considerable 
                                       constancy over 
I speak of <i>an</i> idea, not <i>many</i>.    <a href="Asoldasweare.html" class="hidden">many  centuries</a>. 
This small repertory of associations 
                        among which the reader can select, 
                                     to be interpreted 
                                     as you please. Or rather, 
                                     as you are     so compelled, 
                                     if you are     so compelled 
                                     to read, 
                                     to find a passage through the pages, 
                                             a path    through the mass 
                                                                of phrases, 
the hoard of words.

I am concerned not        only with the “real”  but the <i>labyrinthine</i>  passage by which reality is penetrated 
by the fabulous,               which is  not to say false.     There is truth in   the fable,  though fables are not 
strictly true.               A fable articulates a  truth      prosaic explanation will botch. Enforced circuitousness, 
                                                     disorientation, planned chaos, the <i>bivium</i>, inextricable intricacy,
how constellations operate in things,                                    metaphors, and texts.  Dead ends leading nowhere, 
                                                                                                to confuse and frustrate, 
                                                                                             or is bewilderment merely 
a byproduct, a single winding way leading inevitably to the center and then out again? You must see  what       there is. 
A maze       in the cathedral nave.
