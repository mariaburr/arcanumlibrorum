                            The loss of friends, 
                                     of what was 
                              gained, 
                                 the dissonance, 
                                     dissension, 
                            in haste, 
                        without pre-examination. 
                                     Of what use 
                            is life?             I should think 
you can see that        youâ€™re here,  and you will always remain here. 
It matters not where    you may go.

Around the floating island bronze ramparts rise. 
             Sheer cliffs shoot from sea to sky. 
          Light of the upper regions, invisible. 
                            They feast forever, 
                             breathe the savor 
                                     of roasting meat, 
                                          as low moaning 
                                           pipes drone 
a resonance.                        He denied me nothing. 
                                           Bound howling winds 
from every quarter.     It matters not where             
                        you may go.                       
Yet reckless                                       folly swept us on 
 to ruin.                   The old story!
    
                        You may <a href="Thereisnoclearline.html" class="hidden">glimpse        extremity</a> 
                            in a short space  of time.  
                                    We could see 
                                             men tending fires. 
                                        A sudden squall  struck 
                                                     and swept us wailing back 
 to sea.                                         I woke with a start, my spirit churned. 
                                                 Should I leap and drown at once? 
                                                 I bore it all, held firm, hid my face. 
                                                 Why do the blessed deathless gods despise me so? 
A great unbroken sweep of rock, 
a milk-white calm,                           and I, 
a fool alone, anchored                           my black ship, 
                                glimpsed 
no trace of work 
         of beast 
         or man.                                 I am entirely
                            exhausted and alone. We should be 
                             much farther along  
                             than this.   Alas, 
                                           alas 
                                            that 
                                            
                                                 I ever was.
