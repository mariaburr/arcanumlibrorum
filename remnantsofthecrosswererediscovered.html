<body>remnants of the cross were rediscovered
dispute over the composition
I would still be a stranger

increasingly bitter argument between
that relationship also ended badly
a controversial end, when he clashed

the remainder of life passed in obscurity
he would disappear for hours at a time
it was uncertain for how long

whereabouts remain unknown
due to death in the family
may have wanted to disappear voluntarily

confided nothing to friends
broke down in tears
just completely zoned out, no reaction at all

Even in the grimmest of circumstances, a shift in perspective can instigate startling change.
