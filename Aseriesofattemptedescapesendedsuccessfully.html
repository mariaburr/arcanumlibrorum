<a class="hidden" href="Ashborrowingscontinued.html">A</a> series of attempted escapes ended successfully.  They could be grateful for their freedom, the dream fulfilled.  Rather a maiden all life long.
His dress was shabby, though he attempted to keep his clothes clean and mended,
bereft through death or disappearance, abandonment or desertion, or separation or loss
largely solitary
after his father became crippled

did not discover the whereabouts
of tranquil flowered landscapes populated by children and fantastic creatures
originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts

dedicated every remaining day to composing
a single-spaced fantasy manuscript
whose endless pages concluded: I had a very poor nothing like Christmas. Never had a good Christmas all my life, nor a good new year, and now... I am very bitter but fortunately not revengeful, though I feel should be how I am...

The scars on her back never faded as long as she lived, lacerated as she was. 
As she approached, trembling, he held out 
a branch of the most beautiful leaves and magnificent flowers, saying,
"Take these, beloved, and offer them to the lady."

He pointed her out, sitting like an empress on a dais near the altar.
She held out the branch she had received.
The lady took it, broke off a sprig, and gave it back,
saying, "take special care of this for me."
