  Although unavailable, the moment it happens,           a violent  blow, when,     as was true, the blunt object makes    its intervention without warning, instantaneously reducing the victim  to a fascinating <a href="blankpages.html">blank spot</a> in the continuity  of events. The briefest variety of episode. Some enclosed form crept about and lost. An enormous parody. A number of smaller within it followed, there is no single,   consistent narrator, one  difficulty with this,  however position is that  if there is   then at least  nearly all so much alike. In general  threatened by    a whale,   toss this over the side to divert the attention of the beast, the question, a faulty allegory, a madman or fool,  the book is not  one. Preserve the ship,    intensifying dangers  allay them      to provoke a response. 
       The digressions      frustrate readers who expect a clear purpose. Each has its own topic, and each is  an essay on its particular sidelight.      An impersonation of a different author. Some have argued that the narrator of the tale is a character, just as would be    given    the evidence about the acrimony of his   departure, how   uninvolved he’d been, the number of repeated observations about himself seems reasonable, a cackling hen, enough nonsense, ears of wisdom, cream sherry, grey    worms, outlandish  and  require   a miltant, aware, thoughtful reader,   together  each is a trick, they train you to sniff out the bunk and reject   the unacceptable. There had not been          for  a time. 
  Whatever fear or pain one experiences is displaced  to a later moment.  Transformed by a spell into a rattling sudden. A crash, a shoal of fish,        contents tossed aside, tumbling. There was a white flash.   I  r e c a l l  a yawning. My field of vision split   in two  opposed directions.  Upwards and downwards along a glassy barrier.  What remains would be discovered later on,   in fragments, one  by one, left  along  the  ditch by the roadside  where I was       limping away from whatever    mess it was.     A tree growing  in discomfort, an  emergency, green and resolved, breathes with anguish throughout all the earth as I would.     An acre wide dream   glistening with liquid. Hear hymns, there are none, he shrinks, cuts himself a mouth, sucks up wet skin, divides,  reassembles, coughs up an apology, petrified, briefly pauses, stumbles, feels his face and finds it made of long-buried flesh, rubbish. Should never sleep. He chatters in the voice of a cultured fool, the dry papery sound of wings, the quaint memory of himself as cyclical, reliable, he slips through, he sings, one grim song after another. Recirculation, circumambulation, return, return again.
A glowing, <a href="bennu.html">burning bird</a>          from a faraway land,      blessing   and harbinger      of doom to its captor.   Majestic plumage brightly emitting red, orange,  yellow light, like  a bonfire just  past    the turbulent flame. The feathers do not cease radiating if removed. One feather can illuminate a large room. A smallish fire-colored falcon, complete with a crest and tail and smoldering “eyes”. Beautiful danger, no sign of friendliness shown, save toward the little humpbacked horse, the golden-maned steed, and the gray wolf. The little magical horse helps a peasant boy make many unreasonable demands of the emperor. Censors banned the complete story for many years. The tale was published with omitted verses and songs in many sections. Beyond the mountains, behind the forests, over wide seas, not in the sky but on earth, <a href="blankpages.html#thepoorvillage">there once lived an old man in a poor village</a>.
   Resume. Reading how even once again and was still       unknown,    I watched across the fallow snow,    <i>O bella Roma!</i>  I saw our stewards go forward, life changed to landscape much against   my  will.     I left the city of God unfurled, <a href="whentheybegotme.html#aneagle">the eagle</a>, he was one of us only, pure prose. The field of vision defined by a ritual formula (templum in aere) to observe the   (impetrative) auspices   (see auspicium) from the flight of birds; lightning was observed in the semicircular celestial templum; the quadrangular area delimited and inaugurated by the augures.    I envy the conspicuous waste,  the universe. Thus a (sacred) section, to stretch, string, whence also an open space for observation;  open, clear, broad space, a space dedicated to  some deity; a shrine,        a sanctuary.
