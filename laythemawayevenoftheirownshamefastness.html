<body>                lay them away even of their own shamefastness,
                toys and trifles                            rainy days which meant staying indoors
                when they wax big                           going down to the drawing room
                do cast away nuts, brooches, and puppets    at five o'clock, usually one kept
                                                            away until dinner, to chat, to see the lamps, to see the post arrive,
                how divers fantasies also  to glance at the papers and hear the words Put another log on the first we've still half an hour till dinner.
<i>a very</i>          and minds they do cause  for example whom nothing could daunt, visiting ladies, always those who,
<i>pleasant tale</i>   never so plainly did I perceive  one had told oneself this morning would be pretty sure to come
                                                            and what a bore that would be!
                the bright shining and glistering           The wind stirs things that make
                of their gay clothing dazzled the eyes  shadows when  they shake
                of the silly poor utopians

                A storm on the sea of Galilee
                Albeit does move
                found fault at golden chains
                so small and weak a bondsman
<i>O witty head!</i>   might break them

                Imagine never seeing again
                it would have done a man good
                to have seen how profoundly
                they displayed their peacock's feathers
                how much they made 
                of their painted sheaths 
                how loftily they set forth and advanced themselves, for all the people were swarmed forth into the streets, how much deceived, how far they missed of their purpose, reverently saluted the vilest and most abject.
                Yea, you should have seen children that had cast away their pearls and precious stones, dig and push their mothers under the sides, "look, mother, how great a lubber doth yet wear those as though a little child still."
                "Peace, son," saith she, "they be some of the fools," found fault when it pleased and cast off and run away at liberty whither he would, when so great abundance of gold so lightly esteemed, all the costly ornaments worth enough to abate their courage, for the very shame laid away all that gorgeous array whereof they delight in the doubtful glistering of little trifling stone, which may behold of any of the stars or the Sun itself.

<i>Doubtful, he</i>    Or that any man is so mad
<i>call it either</i>  as to count himself the nobler
<i>in consider</i>     for the finer thread of wool
<i>-ation and</i> 
<i>respect of</i>
<i>counterfeit</i>     none knew what then became
<i>stones, very</i>    of the nothing what was
<i>little worth.</i>   whereabouts when washed ashore
                the poor thing barely breathing
                expelled an ocean from the little lungs
                all apparelled in changeable colours
                infamed and reproachable,
                trimmed and adorned with all those things
                which were the punishment of bondsman
                of trifles children play withal

                Saluted then by undressed men swarming round like starving beasts a kill
                his carcass glowing in unrecognizable light, wonderous his misery
                did they greet this apparition as would they the return of what long ago was lost
                robust gratitude shown in ceremonious shadow, in the deepening twilight
                
                mind began to wander
                what was afterall
                like the tightrope walker
                who'd fotgotten his feet
                lapses staring at me 
                felt swaying precarious structure
                on which my body perched
                ends of the balancing pole 
                gleaming far out on the edges
                no longer guiding lights 
                but malignant enticements
                to cast myself into the depths. Now and then,
                                                a thought
                                                succeeded in emerging
<i>Must have been desparate to escape so</i>           with clarity before me 
<i>hoary a predicament, eh? Hoist yer</i>              but in no position
<i>self out of the crucible by ingenious</i>           to capture it,
<i>exertions of yer cleverness? Well then!</i>         the endless possibilites of language,
                                                to which I once could safely abandon myself
                                                became a conglomeration of inane phrases
                                                false and hollow.

                Did I then peregrinate endlessly, doomed to take solace in drift? gone meekly, without word?
                I woulda lept into any abyss, throw my own self overboard into the brine, embrace a state of great confusion,
                as if an illness latent in me for a long time finally erupted, some soul-destroying and inexorable force
                
                A world unwound from my spool.
                An old city full of streets and squares, nooks and crevices, some quarters empty others overflowing with exuberent, overwhelming life.
                the endless twisting strands formed threads of an encompassing web in which everything tangled and trapped was caught waiting to be drained of what gave it pathetic, desparate, impotent animation.
                Is that a serpent in the window?
                Infinite convulsing recalcitrant.
                What was it issued forth from frothing waters?
                Recirculate the drek into drunken interior forever.
                A ghost weeping in wasteland abandoned, there was I, wherever.
                A trumpeting from beyond mountainous horizon resounded a groaning monstrosity.
                Wake, don't yet, forget what were, wretched reaches kept distant now encroach
                Threads make ropes to tie arms and legs behind the back to incapacitate resistant captive.
                I know it, well I know it. Fastened upon me, gradually paralyze entire system, dreadful torpor heralds disintegration,
                I had neither memory nor power of thought, nor even existence, not any, all my life a constant obliteration, incessant, relentless, merciless, divine.
                If someone had come then to lead me away to a place of execution I would have gone meekly without a word without so much as opening my eyes, not knowing how I could begin again.

                Have you courage to pick apart words and find in the thicket the lost? The wasn't? Never? Naught?
                Stephen and the vile, unending disaster, the dark lamplight, casting shapeless creatures from the fading glow,
                Oh my dislocating princess, I will find your child, however buried in the contorted wreckage, I can hear his echo cry, resonate in e very pas sage
