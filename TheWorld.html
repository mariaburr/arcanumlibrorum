to encounter a great unity,
dancing figure at the center
one leg crossed
a wand in either hand

a green wreath of flowers surrounds
red ribbons wrap around, reminiscent of infinity
four corners of the universe
harmony between all

this state described as enlightenment
we all sway along the flow of life
you hear this rhythm, you participate,
following the joys and sorrows
