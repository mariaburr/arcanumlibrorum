After the dreams, we had to decide what to do next. I wake up, I feel sleepy the same way I feel alive, the caress of dullness, flower of the useless, my name never pronounced, disquiet between margins, privilege of yielded obligations
delay could cause grave danger
in the farthest south, heretics still survived recalcitrant and insolent

Give ear, my son
Let no one persuade you that you have no superior
for he's a fool who thinks so

Deum Time: My master's sword is steel; the Pope's is made of words
there is one body and one head, not two heads like a monster
we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject

wretched creature, ugly contorted thing  I have great wonder, be this light how that I live
god bless you                                                               for day and night
                                                                            I may not sleep well nigh noght
The love of beauty                                                          I have so many an ydel thoght
seems a perfect example
of an i m p u l s e                 Read alongside sacred scripture
inibited in its aim                 The concept corresponds    to the Greek philosophical belief
a gateway through which             that man  apart of coherent universe                  from earliest tymes express'd
fulfillment by some means           be capable of concluding through reason               in collection of story 
or o t h e r                        that God known first his revealed words                  concerning a mortal world to create
comes to nothing.                                                                          a cosmos free acting and conspiring
                                                                                           as motion and position of stars and planets
Efforts led mortals to believe intervention possible  sorcery and manipulation of nature   to bend gods
Thales resided within an integral part                                                     a reason to know
appeared under certain conditions                                                          by both books 
bound in necessary chains

origins were removed
abandoning ancient ties 
to free acting, conspiring          the upper world left vacant
irrelevant unseen forces            incessant causation presumed                           the pathway to heaven became clear:
                                    since motion is revealed
                                          unable to be not
