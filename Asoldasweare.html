As old 
 as we 
  are 
   able   to imagine, 
          worked over 
             and over 
    again,   expanded, 
     abstracted,       turned into verse, 
                     retold   in   prose, 
                   translated into medieval    and modern 
                                   vernaculars and 
                 retranslated back into        the original 
                         forgotten tongue.     The prelude    identifies                       an octogenarian monk 
       as author.                               It remains unclear if he 
                                                                   is himself                  a real historical person 
                                   or literary invention,                   perhaps his own. 
                                                                                    His name,      
                                                                                    now lost, 
                                 was certainly fictitious.                          The title 
found in one old manuscript:                                                        the little story book.
From where, for everlasting, gleams the garden,                                      in shadow and in breeze, 
                                                                                     as lightning fire. Black, as wind, with dry delirious heat, 
                                                                                     inflames my reason, and in the centre of my soul keeps empire for a child. 
We should remind ourselves,                    <a href="Thelossoffriends.html" class="hidden">the original is lost</a>. 
Recall the wise conduct of life.                                                                                                        What is learning whose attainment sees no passion wane? Finds no congenial path, no final goal? 
                                                                                                                                                        Straining for a name, and gaining none? For the benefit of ignorant princes? 
The narrative illustrates, 
                 operates in succession, 
         stories embedded, 
     one opening 
  within another, 
unending return 
      to <a href="Theendcomesupon.html" class="hidden">renewed beginning</a>.
