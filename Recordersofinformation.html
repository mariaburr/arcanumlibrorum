<body>Recorders of information 
long looked for ways 
to categorize and 
   compile   it.       There   are various methods of 
            arranging layers of references within a    document. 
                          Other reference  works  also developed 
            (for example: dictionaries, encyclopaedias) 
                                                    a precursor to hypertext: 
                                                    the setting of certain words 
                                                    in <span style="font-variant:small-caps">small capital letters</span>, 
                                                    indicating that 
                                                    an entry existed for that term within 
                         the same  reference    work
several scholars entered the scene who believed that humanity was drowning 
in information, causing foolish decisions and duplicating efforts                
two visionaries attacked the cross-referencing problem through proposals based on labor-intensive, brute force methods

the monographic principle, in which all documents would be decomposed down to unique phrases

In the 1930s, H.G. Wells proposed the creation of a World Brain.

The pre-war information retrieval specialists of continental Europe, the 'documentalists,' largely disregarded by post-war information retrieval specialists, had ideas that were considerably more advanced than is now generally realized.

In 1945, Vannevar Bush wrote an article in called "As We May Think", about a futuristic device he called a Memex. He described the device as an electromechanical desk linked to an extensive archive of microfilms, able to display books, writings, or any document from a library. The Memex would also be able to create 'trails' of linked and branching sets of pages, combining pages from the published microfilm library with personal annotations or additions captured on a microfilm recorder. 
Bush's vision was based on extensions of 1945 technologyâ€”microfilm recording and retrieval in this case. The Memex directly influenced and inspired the two American men generally credited with the invention of hypertext, Ted Nelson and Douglas Engelbart.
